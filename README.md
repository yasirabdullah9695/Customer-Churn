🔁 Customer Churn Prediction.....

📌 Overview
A machine learning classification model to predict whether a customer is likely to churn based on demographic and usage data.

🧰 Tools & Technologies
Python, Pandas

Scikit-learn

Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost

The churns.ipynb notebook includes:

Importing necessary libraries: numpy, pandas, matplotlib.pyplot, seaborn, sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split, and sklearn.metrics.accuracy_score.

Loading the dataset: Reads churn.csv into a pandas DataFrame.

Initial data inspection: Displays the first and last few rows of the dataset (churns.head(), churns.tail()) and lists column names (churns.columns).

Data Visualization: Uses seaborn.FacetGrid for plotting, which suggests an exploration of relationships between variables.

Further cells are expected to contain more data cleaning, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation steps.
